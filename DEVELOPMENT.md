# Useful notes for development process

- `d3fc-sample` has rogue `.babelrc` file, don't forget to remove it, `npm run postinstall` should take care of that.

- Add the `react-native/Libraries/ART/ART.xcodeproj` to XCode. Link the binary.

- After installing native dependencies, don't forget to link: `react-native link`, or [facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html)
